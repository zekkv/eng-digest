# Architecture

This project is opinionated towards [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and renders on the server with TanStack Start and Nitro.

## Core Stack

- **Framework**: [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) — full-stack React with TanStack Router, server functions, and SSR.
- **Server**: [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) — handles server-side logic and deployment presets.
- **ORM & Database**: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) with Bun's native SQL driver (`bun:sql` / `drizzle-orm/bun-sql`).
- **Auth**: [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com/) — email + password, email OTP, passkeys, and optional Google OAuth. Rate limited at the Better Auth layer (20 req/60 s).
- **Theme**: [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) — class-based theme management on `html` with a mounted client toggle.

## Data Flow

1. **Routing**: Managed by TanStack Router. `src/routes/__root.tsx` composes the shell, theme provider, header, and page outlet.
2. **SSR**: TanStack Start handles the initial HTML render on the server via Nitro.
3. **Protected routes**: `src/routes/__root.tsx` resolves the session once per navigation and puts `{ user }` on the route context, which the header uses to render the signed-in nav on the server. The pathless `_authenticated.tsx` layout only refuses an unauthenticated visitor with a redirect to `/login` and re-emits the narrowed user for child routes (`dashboard.tsx`, `settings.tsx`). Auth routes (`/login`, `/signup`) redirect signed-in arrivals to `/dashboard`.
4. **Server functions**: `src/features/notes/server-fns.ts` exposes `listNotes`, `createNote`, and `deleteNote`, and `src/features/uploads/server-fns.ts` exposes `createUploadUrl`, all via `createServerFn`. Every function runs behind the middleware in `src/features/auth/session.ts`, which resolves the session. A refusal is a thrown `Error`, the behaviour TanStack Start documents: the caller catches it and reads `message`. The middleware's catch calls `setResponseStatus` first, so a direct HTTP caller still sees the status: 400 when the payload misses the schema, 401 without a session, 404 when the row is missing, 422 when the payload parses but the server refuses it, and 503 when a dependency is unconfigured.
5. **Query cache**: `src/router.tsx` creates one TanStack Query `QueryClient` per router (30s default `staleTime`) and `setupRouterSsrQueryIntegration` supplies the provider plus SSR dehydration/hydration. Route loaders prefetch with the same `queryOptions` objects their components read (`accountOptions` in `src/features/auth/accounts.ts`); mutations over loader-owned data call `router.invalidate()`.
6. **Auth flow**: Forms in `src/features/auth/components/*` call `src/lib/auth-client.ts`. `/login` supports email + password, email OTP, passkeys, and Google OAuth (when configured). `/signup` creates a password account (then holds the user on a "check your email" prompt) or sends an OTP; `/verify-otp` confirms the code and offers passkey enrollment; `/reset-password` both requests a reset link and consumes it (`?token=`).
7. **File uploads**: `createUploadUrl` in `src/features/uploads/server-fns.ts` validates the request through `src/features/uploads/schema.ts` and reaches `handleCreateUploadUrl` in `presign.server.ts` through a dynamic import. It presigns a `uploads/<userId>/<uuid>.<ext>` PUT URL and returns `{ url, key }`; the dashboard PUTs the file bytes straight to storage, so the server never proxies them. An unsupported content type or a file over 10 MB is a 422, and an unset `MINIO_ENDPOINT` is a 503.

## Database & Migrations

PostgreSQL is accessed using [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) paired with Bun's native SQL driver (`bun:sql` via `drizzle-orm/bun-sql`).

- **Schemas**: Defined in `src/db/schema.ts` (application tables such as `notes`) and `src/db/auth-schema.ts` (Better Auth tables: `user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`, `passkey`).
- **Migrations Directory**: Configured in `drizzle.config.ts` to output migrations to `src/db/drizzle/`.
- **Generating Migrations**: When schema files are updated, run `bun run db:generate` to produce timestamped SQL migration files and update the snapshot journal in `src/db/drizzle/meta/`. Never handwrite SQL migrations.
- **Applying Migrations**: Run `bun run db:migrate` to execute pending SQL migrations against the configured database (`DATABASE_URL`). For quick local development without migration tracking, `bun run db:push` can be used.

For developer commands, seeding, and local workflows, see the [Development Guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md#database-management--migrations).

## Authentication

Handled by **Better Auth**. Supported flows:

- **Email + password** — sign up and sign in with a password. The sign-up and reset forms share `PasswordSchema` (`src/features/auth/schema/password.ts`): 8–128 characters with at least one number and one symbol. That policy is client-side; Better Auth itself only enforces its 8-character minimum, so add a `before` hook on `/sign-up/email` and `/reset-password` if you need it enforced server-side too. Always available. Password hashes live in the existing `account.password` column, so no migration is involved. Sign-ups are stored with an empty `name`, matching what the email-OTP flow does, and are auto-signed-in (`requireEmailVerification` is off, so an unverified user can still sign in).
- **Email verification** — `emailVerification.sendOnSignUp` mails a link via the `VerificationEmail` template; Better Auth's own `/api/auth/verify-email` endpoint consumes it, so there is no app route for it. `/signup` shows a "check your email" prompt after a password sign-up rather than navigating away, because the window this closes is otherwise invisible: an email-OTP sign-in by an **unverified** user triggers Better Auth's `revokeUnprovenAccountAccess`, which deletes every account row and session that user has (its defence against someone registering a password on an address they do not own) — so an unverified password would be discarded the first time that user signs in with a code. Verified users keep their password across an OTP sign-in. Set `emailAndPassword.requireEmailVerification: true` if you would rather block sign-in until the link is clicked.
- **Password reset** — `/reset-password` sends a link (1 hour expiry) via `ResetPasswordEmail`. Better Auth's callback bounces the emailed link off `/api/auth/reset-password/:token` and back to `/reset-password?token=…`, or `?error=INVALID_TOKEN` when it has expired. Reset also _creates_ a credential account when the user has none, so OTP-only and Google-only users can adopt a password this way. It does not create a session; the user signs in afterwards.
- **Email OTP** — sign in and sign up via one-time code. Always available.
- **Passkeys** — register and authenticate with a device credential. Always available.
- **Google OAuth** — enabled only when `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are set. The app boots and functions without them.

Rate limiting is configured at 20 requests per 60-second window using Better Auth's built-in `rateLimit` option.

## Styling

**Tailwind CSS v4** is integrated via `@tailwindcss/vite`. Theme switching is class-based on the `html` element through `next-themes`.

## Observability

### LogTape + Sentry

LogTape provides the app logger in `src/lib/logger.ts`. The server bootstrap (`instrument.server.mjs`) initialises Sentry with:

- `dataCollection` — user identifiers, cookies, request bodies, and database payloads are not forwarded.
- `tracesSampleRate: 0.1` — 10% of server traces are sampled to control cost.

Loosen `dataCollection` and raise `tracesSampleRate` only intentionally, after reviewing your data-handling obligations.
